							    <h5>What is the Benn Method?</h5>
								<p class="mb-3">The fundamental basis for this work is the idea that unprocessed emotions, traumas, and memories are stored in our bodies until they can be processed and released. In the Energetic Body, these unprocessed memories create blockages to the flow of energy through various meridians.  These blockages then manifest physically or in one’s mental or emotional state.  In the physical body, blockages may manifest as tension, pain, dysfunction or disease. For instance, blockages in the throat may create thyroid issues, tonsillitis or infection.  Blockages in the spine may lead to poor posture, chronic back pain or recurring headaches.  These energetic blockages can also manifest on the emotional level as depression, anxiety, dissociation, rage, and other imbalances.  Mentally, these blockages are connected to unhealthy and limiting thought patterns such as self-abusive thoughts.  Blockages often leave people feeling deeply disconnected from their own spirit and the spirit in everything around them.  This disconnectedness is at the root of deep unhappiness for many people and is so common in our society.</p>
