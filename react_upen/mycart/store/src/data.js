    price: 14999,
    company: "SAMSUNG",
    info:
      "The Galaxy M30 is Samsung's offering in the sub Rs. 15,000 segment and sports a Super AMOLED display. We liked the full-HD+ panel which was crisp and got bright enough when outdoors. Powering the phone is a Samsung Exynos 7904 SoC which offers acceptable performance for the price. The processor can handle light to medium tasks but warms up under load. It has 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage. It has a dedicated microSD card slot which helps expand storage by up to 512GB. There is a triple camera setup at the back which clicks good photos and so does the selfie camera. We weren't happy with the fact that this smartphone shipped with Android Oreo with Samsung Experience UI on top instead of One UI with Android Pie. The 5000mAh battery offers good battery life.",

    info:
      "The Redmi Note 7 Pro is one of the most feature packed phones in its price bracket, bringing a premium design, capable octa-core processor, 48-megapixel camera, and fast charging support to the table. The phone packs a 6.3-inch full-HD+ (1080x2340 pixels) LTPS In-Cell display protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass 5. Content on the display looks sharp with crisp colours, but at the same time, it is also quite reflective.The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 675 processor ticking alongside up to 6GB of RAM. Be it heavy multitasking or games like PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9, the phone barely struggles at all. The Redmi Note 7 Pro runs MIUI 10 based on Android 9 Pie, and even though it is rich in features, you will also have to see pesky ads.The phoneâ€™s 48-megapixel main camera captures beautiful images with ample detail, high dynamic range, and good vibrancy. The night mode also performs well, while selfies captured by the 32-megapixel front camera also look sharp with natural colours and edge detection in bokeh mode. The 4,000mAh battery ensures that the Redmi Note 7 Pro easily sails past a full day of usage, while support for Qualcomm's Quick Charge 4.0 fast charging technology helps to quickly top up the battery.",

    info:
      "The Realme 3 Pro is the company's latest flagship, designed to take on the Redmi Note 7 Pro from Xiaomi. It features some new colours options and the same small notch and slim bezels as its predecessor, the Realme 2 Pro. The 6.3-inch full-HD+ IPS display produces vivid colours and is very legible under direct sunlight. You also get two Nano-SIM slots and a dedicated spot for a microSD card.This is currently the only phone under Rs. 20,000 to sport the recent Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 SoC. It's an efficient chip built on the 10nm fabrication process and features a better GPU compared to a Snapdragon 675, which shows in benchmarks and games. The phone is available in two variants -- 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage and 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which is what we have. ColorOS 6 is based on Android 9 Pie, which runs smoothly and also gives you plenty of shortcuts and gestures.App and gaming performance is very good. The phone doesn't heat up during regular use and even with gaming, barely gets warm. The main 16-megapixel sensor captures detailed landscapes and macros under good light. The secondary 5-megapixel sensor is also good at edge detection. At night, images are generally soft but the Nightscape mode helps in bringing out better detail in objects. Videos can be recorded up to 4K resolution but without stabilisation. Finally, the 4045mAh battery will last you a full day on one charge and a VOOC 3.0 fast charger is bundled in the box.",

    title: "Asus 6Z(Black, 64 GB)(6 GB RAM) ",
    img: "img/product-5.PNG",
    price: 31999,
    company: "ASUS",
    info:
      "The Asus 6Z is a budget flagship contender with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor and 4.4-inch notchless screen. Its main selling point is a flip-up camera module that lets you use the primary 48-megapixel Sony IMX586 camera and secondary 13-megapixel wide-angle camera for selfies as well as the usual photos. The camera module needs to flip around every time you want to use face recognition or take a selfie, which means there's a slight delay. Asus has thought of a few tricks though, such as the ability to take sweeping panoramas with one tap, or pivot the module while in the middle of recording a video. You can even set its position manually to take some creatively angled shots.In terms of design, the 6Z is fairly plain, with only the bright blue Asus logo and text on the rear standing out against the Midnight Black Body. The Twilight Silver option offers a silver-blue gradient. There is a 3.5mm audio socket on the bottom along with the USB Type-C port. An extra button on the right is set to trigger Google Assistant by default but can be reprogrammed. There's no IP rating but Asus has used Gorilla Glass 6 on the front.Performance is great thanks to the high-end processor and ample RAM. The full-HD+ screen supports HDR and was bright and vibrant in our experience. We were slightly underwhelmed with the cameras at night, as our photos were somtimes a little blurry. Battery life was good but not great, and we think that Asus's promise of two-day usage is optimistic.The Asus 6Z is a compelling option at its price, and brings a lot of power to a hot market segment.",

    price: 18490,
    company: "SAMSUNG",
    info:
      "The Samsung Galaxy A50 looks a lot like the Galaxy M10 and M20, but it has a few premium features such as a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen, an in-display fingerprint sensor, and three rear cameras. The back of this phone has a unique iridescent finish that reflects light dramatically in rainbow patterns. Samsung has used its premium Exynos 9610 SoC which is a solid performer for this price segment and supports camera features such as intelligent scene optimisation and 480fps slow-motion video recording. Performance is generally quite good, especially in terms of the display and battery life. The cameras are versatile but there are situations, such as in low light, when the results could have been better. The Galaxy A50 offers a lot of features that people really look for, and is a good all-rounder that might help Samsung fight off its competitors.",
