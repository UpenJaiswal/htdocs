Dr. Mitts and his aesthetician, Lisa Murphy, RN, aim to provide every patient with the highest quality treatment and care, and the clinic bases its ethos on helping patients achieve their cosmetic and reconstructive goals.\r\n\r\nDr. Mitts comes from a family of physicians, including his father and two uncles, and after graduating from La Sierra University in Riverside, California, he pursued his own calling into the field of medicine. He obtained his medical degree from Loma Linda University Medical Center, California, and gained extensive experience in a series of surgical residency positions before opening Mitts Plastic Surgery in Bakersfield.\r\n\r\nDr. Mitts understands the importance of educating himself on the most advanced treatment options available and the latest technological developments to optimize the patient experience and increase patient comfort and safety while reducing healing time. He uses the most effective, state-of-the-art treatments at Mitts Plastic Surgery, such as the SMAS face-lift that targets underlying muscle for a natural-looking result, and minimally invasive ultrasonic liposuction that aids fat removal.\r\n\r\nDr. Mitts and his team want to help you feel happier, healthier, and more confident so you can enjoy your life to the fullest, and they pride themselves on providing both excellent patient care and refined aesthetic results.'),

This is required when, for example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known as \'fill text\'.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What are the benefits of breast augmentation?</h4>\r\nBreast augmentation offers a number of benefits for women, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Creating a more rounded breast shape</li>\r\n 	<li>Increasing fullness and size of breasts</li>\r\n 	<li>Correcting breast size asymmetry</li>\r\n 	<li>Restoring breast size and shape after weight loss</li>\r\n 	<li>Restoring breast size and shape following pregnancy and breastfeeding</li>\r\n 	<li>Improving the breast and hip ratios to create a well-balanced silhouette</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nUltimately, breast augmentation is designed to improve your self-image and increase your confidence.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do I book breast augmentation surgery?</h4>\r\nIf you think breast augmentation could be a good choice, make an appointment to talk through the options with Dr. Mitts. He reviews your medical history at your consultation, and you can discuss the various factors involved in breast augmentation surgery, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The size and shape of the implants</li>\r\n 	<li>The materials used</li>\r\n 	<li>What happens during the procedure</li>\r\n 	<li>Recovery time</li>\r\n 	<li>What you can expect to achieve from the surgery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Mitts also needs to make sure that you are physically and psychologically fit for the operation and that you have realistic expectations of the results of the surgery.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Does breast augmentation help if my breasts are sagging?</h4>\r\nBreast augmentation can’t fix severely drooping breasts on its own, but Dr. Mitts can assess your suitability for a breast lift operation, or combined breast lift and augmentation procedure. A breast lift raises the breasts, which may or may not then need implants to restore their youthful shape.\r\n\r\nAt your consultation, Dr. Mitts advises you on the best choice between a breast lift and augmentation, or a combination of the two, to ensure you achieve your desired results.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What happens during a breast augmentation operation?</h4>\r\nWhen you choose Mitts Plastic Surgery for your operation, your comfort is a priority. Dr. Mitts recommends the optimal combination of sedation and anesthesia to keep you comfortable; and, then, when the medications take effect, he makes an incision in an inconspicuous area of your breast to minimize the visibility of the surgical scar.\r\n\r\nAfter making the incision, Dr. Mitts inserts the implant, which can be placed under the pectoral muscle, or behind the breast tissue and over the pectoral muscle. After correctly positioning the implant, Dr. Mitts closes the incision, and your operation is complete.\r\n\r\nYou’ll see the results immediately, but there may be some bruising and swelling, which should disappear within a few days. Dr. Mitts produces natural-looking results that give you the breasts you desire, so book an appointment to discuss breast augmentation surgery by calling Mitts Plastic Surgery today or making an appointment online.'),

Dr. Mitts recommends the optimal combination of sedation and anesthesia to keep you comfortable; and, then, when the medications take effect, he makes an incision in an inconspicuous area of your breast to minimize the visibility of the surgical scar.\r\n\r\nAfter making the incision, Dr. Mitts inserts the implant, which can be placed under the pectoral muscle, or behind the breast tissue and over the pectoral muscle. After correctly positioning the implant, Dr. Mitts closes the incision, and your operation is complete.\r\n\r\nYou’ll see the results immediately, but there may be some bruising and swelling, which should disappear within a few days.

He reviews your medical history at your consultation, and you can discuss the various factors involved in breast augmentation surgery, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The size and shape of the implants</li>\r\n 	<li>The materials used</li>\r\n 	<li>What happens during the procedure</li>\r\n 	<li>Recovery time</li>\r\n 	<li>What you can expect to achieve from the surgery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Mitts also needs to make sure that you are physically and psychologically fit for the operation and that you have realistic expectations of the results of the surgery.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Does breast augmentation help if my breasts are sagging?</h4>\r\nBreast augmentation can’t fix severely drooping breasts on its own, but Dr. Mitts can assess your suitability for a breast lift operation, or combined breast lift and augmentation procedure. A breast lift raises the breasts, which may or may not then need implants to restore their youthful shape.\r\n\r\nAt your consultation, Dr. Mitts advises you on the best choice between a breast lift and augmentation, or a combination of the two, to ensure you achieve your desired results.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What happens during a breast augmentation operation?</h4>\r\nWhen you choose Mitts Plastic Surgery for your operation, your comfort is a priority. Dr. Mitts recommends the optimal combination of sedation and anesthesia to keep you comfortable; and, then, when the medications take effect, he makes an incision in an inconspicuous area of your breast to minimize the visibility of the surgical scar.\r\n\r\nAfter making the incision, Dr. Mitts inserts the implant, which can be placed under the pectoral muscle, or behind the breast tissue and over the pectoral muscle. After correctly positioning the implant, Dr. Mitts closes the incision, and your operation is complete.\r\n\r\nYou’ll see the results immediately, but there may be some bruising and swelling, which should disappear within a few days. Dr. Mitts produces natural-looking results that give you the breasts you desire, so book an appointment to discuss breast augmentation surgery by calling Mitts Plastic Surgery today or making an appointment online.'),

He reviews your medical history at your consultation, and you can discuss the various factors involved in breast augmentation surgery, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The size and shape of the implants</li>\r\n 	<li>The materials used</li>\r\n 	<li>What happens during the procedure</li>\r\n 	<li>Recovery time</li>\r\n 	<li>What you can expect to achieve from the surgery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Mitts also needs to make sure that you are physically and psychologically fit for the operation and that you have realistic expectations of the results of the surgery.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Does breast augmentation help if my breasts are sagging?</h4>\r\nBreast augmentation can’t fix severely drooping breasts on its own, but Dr. Mitts can assess your suitability for a breast lift operation, or combined breast lift and augmentation procedure. A breast lift raises the breasts, which may or may not then need implants to restore their youthful shape.\r\n\r\nAt your consultation, Dr. Mitts advises you on the best choice between a breast lift and augmentation, or a combination of the two, to ensure you achieve your desired results.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What happens during a breast augmentation operation?</h4>\r\nWhen you choose Mitts Plastic Surgery for your operation, your comfort is a priority. Dr. Mitts recommends the optimal combination of sedation and anesthesia to keep you comfortable; and, then, when the medications take effect, he makes an incision in an inconspicuous area of your breast to minimize the visibility of the surgical scar.\r\n\r\nAfter making the incision, Dr. Mitts inserts the implant, which can be placed under the pectoral muscle, or behind the breast tissue and over the pectoral muscle. After correctly positioning the implant, Dr. Mitts closes the incision, and your operation is complete.\r\n\r\nYou’ll see the results immediately, but there may be some bruising and swelling, which should disappear within a few days. Dr. Mitts produces natural-looking results that give you the breasts you desire, so book an appointment to discuss breast augmentation surgery by calling Mitts Plastic Surgery today or making an appointment online.'),

He reviews your medical history at your consultation, and you can discuss the various factors involved in breast augmentation surgery, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The size and shape of the implants</li>\r\n 	<li>The materials used</li>\r\n 	<li>What happens during the procedure</li>\r\n 	<li>Recovery time</li>\r\n 	<li>What you can expect to achieve from the surgery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Mitts also needs to make sure that you are physically and psychologically fit for the operation and that you have realistic expectations of the results of the surgery.\r\n<h4></h4>\r\n<h4>Does breast augmentation help if my breasts are sagging?</h4>\r\nBreast augmentation can’t fix severely drooping breasts on its own, but Dr. Mitts can assess your suitability for a breast lift operation, or combined breast lift and augmentation procedure. A breast lift raises the breasts, which may or may not then need implants to restore their youthful shape.\r\n\r\nAt your consultation, Dr. Mitts advises you on the best choice between a breast lift and augmentation, or a combination of the two, to ensure you achieve your desired results.\r\n<h4></h4>\r\n<h4>What happens during a breast augmentation operation?</h4>\r\nWhen you choose Mitts Plastic Surgery for your operation, your comfort is a priority. Dr. Mitts recommends the optimal combination of sedation and anesthesia to keep you comfortable; and, then, when the medications take effect, he makes an incision in an inconspicuous area of your breast to minimize the visibility of the surgical scar.\r\n\r\nAfter making the incision, Dr. Mitts inserts the implant, which can be placed under the pectoral muscle, or behind the breast tissue and over the pectoral muscle. After correctly positioning the implant, Dr. Mitts closes the incision, and your operation is complete.\r\n\r\nYou’ll see the results immediately, but there may be some bruising and swelling, which should disappear within a few days. Dr. Mitts produces natural-looking results that give you the breasts you desire, so book an appointment to discuss breast augmentation surgery by calling Mitts Plastic Surgery today or making an appointment online.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>'),

He reviews your medical history at your consultation, and you can discuss the various factors involved in breast augmentation surgery, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The size and shape of the implants</li>\r\n 	<li>The materials used</li>\r\n 	<li>What happens during the procedure</li>\r\n 	<li>Recovery time</li>\r\n 	<li>What you can expect to achieve from the surgery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Mitts also needs to make sure that you are physically and psychologically fit for the operation and that you have realistic expectations of the results of the surgery.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Does breast augmentation help if my breasts are sagging?</h4>\r\nBreast augmentation can’t fix severely drooping breasts on its own, but Dr. Mitts can assess your suitability for a breast lift operation, or combined breast lift and augmentation procedure. A breast lift raises the breasts, which may or may not then need implants to restore their youthful shape.\r\n\r\nAt your consultation, Dr. Mitts advises you on the best choice between a breast lift and augmentation, or a combination of the two, to ensure you achieve your desired results.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What happens during a breast augmentation operation?</h4>\r\nWhen you choose Mitts Plastic Surgery for your operation, your comfort is a priority. Dr. Mitts recommends the optimal combination of sedation and anesthesia to keep you comfortable; and, then, when the medications take effect, he makes an incision in an inconspicuous area of your breast to minimize the visibility of the surgical scar.\r\n\r\nAfter making the incision, Dr. Mitts inserts the implant, which can be placed under the pectoral muscle, or behind the breast tissue and over the pectoral muscle. After correctly positioning the implant, Dr. Mitts closes the incision, and your operation is complete.\r\n\r\nYou’ll see the results immediately, but there may be some bruising and swelling, which should disappear within a few days. Dr. Mitts produces natural-looking results that give you the breasts you desire, so book an appointment to discuss breast augmentation surgery by calling Mitts Plastic Surgery today or making an appointment online.'),

He reviews your medical history at your consultation, and you can discuss the various factors involved in breast augmentation surgery, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The size and shape of the implants</li>\r\n 	<li>The materials used</li>\r\n 	<li>What happens during the procedure</li>\r\n 	<li>Recovery time</li>\r\n 	<li>What you can expect to achieve from the surgery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Mitts also needs to make sure that you are physically and psychologically fit for the operation and that you have realistic expectations of the results of the surgery.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Does breast augmentation help if my breasts are sagging?</h4>\r\nBreast augmentation can’t fix severely drooping breasts on its own, but Dr. Mitts can assess your suitability for a breast lift operation, or combined breast lift and augmentation procedure. A breast lift raises the breasts, which may or may not then need implants to restore their youthful shape.\r\n\r\nAt your consultation, Dr. Mitts advises you on the best choice between a breast lift and augmentation, or a combination of the two, to ensure you achieve your desired results.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What happens during a breast augmentation operation?</h4>\r\nWhen you choose Mitts Plastic Surgery for your operation, your comfort is a priority. Dr. Mitts recommends the optimal combination of sedation and anesthesia to keep you comfortable; and, then, when the medications take effect, he makes an incision in an inconspicuous area of your breast to minimize the visibility of the surgical scar.\r\n\r\nAfter making the incision, Dr. Mitts inserts the implant, which can be placed under the pectoral muscle, or behind the breast tissue and over the pectoral muscle. After correctly positioning the implant, Dr. Mitts closes the incision, and your operation is complete.\r\n\r\nYou’ll see the results immediately, but there may be some bruising and swelling, which should disappear within a few days. Dr. Mitts produces natural-looking results that give you the breasts you desire, so book an appointment to discuss breast augmentation surgery by calling Mitts Plastic Surgery today or making an appointment online.'),

He reviews your medical history at your consultation, and you can discuss the various factors involved in breast augmentation surgery, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The size and shape of the implants</li>\r\n 	<li>The materials used</li>\r\n 	<li>What happens during the procedure</li>\r\n 	<li>Recovery time</li>\r\n 	<li>What you can expect to achieve from the surgery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Mitts also needs to make sure that you are physically and psychologically fit for the operation and that you have realistic expectations of the results of the surgery.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Does breast augmentation help if my breasts are sagging?</h4>\r\nBreast augmentation can’t fix severely drooping breasts on its own, but Dr. Mitts can assess your suitability for a breast lift operation, or combined breast lift and augmentation procedure. A breast lift raises the breasts, which may or may not then need implants to restore their youthful shape.\r\n\r\nAt your consultation, Dr. Mitts advises you on the best choice between a breast lift and augmentation, or a combination of the two, to ensure you achieve your desired results.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What happens during a breast augmentation operation?</h4>\r\nWhen you choose Mitts Plastic Surgery for your operation, your comfort is a priority. Dr. Mitts recommends the optimal combination of sedation and anesthesia to keep you comfortable; and, then, when the medications take effect, he makes an incision in an inconspicuous area of your breast to minimize the visibility of the surgical scar.\r\n\r\nAfter making the incision, Dr. Mitts inserts the implant, which can be placed under the pectoral muscle, or behind the breast tissue and over the pectoral muscle. After correctly positioning the implant, Dr. Mitts closes the incision, and your operation is complete.\r\n\r\nYou’ll see the results immediately, but there may be some bruising and swelling, which should disappear within a few days. Dr. Mitts produces natural-looking results that give you the breasts you desire, so book an appointment to discuss breast augmentation surgery by calling Mitts Plastic Surgery today or making an appointment online.'),

For women who are unhappy with the shape or size of their breasts, however, feeling confident on a daily basis can prove difficult. Dr. Gordon Mitts is an experienced plastic surgeon, offering a comprehensive range of breast surgery procedures to patients of his Bakersfield, California practice. Through the latest treatment techniques and a finely honed aesthetic eye, Dr. Mitts is able to produce natural-looking results that suit each patient’s individual cosmetic goals. To learn more about the breast surgery options available at Mitts plastic surgery, schedule a surgical consultation at our Bakersfield practice today.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Types of Breast Surgery</h2>\r\nAt Mitts Plastic Surgery, we offer several types of breast surgery to accommodate the various cosmetic and health-related needs of our patients. Dr. Mitts understands that no two women are exactly alike, which is why he works with each patient individually to determine her surgical goals and create an appropriate treatment plan. The breast surgery options available at his Bakersfield practice include:\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Implants</h4>\r\nDr. Mitts offers silicone and saline breast implants to patients who wish to enhance the size of their breasts. Both silicone and saline breast implants provide an aesthetically pleasing and long-lasting result. The type of breast implant that a patient receives will depend on a number of factors, including her medical history and cosmetic goals, as well as Dr. Mitts’ recommendations. By creating an attractive, well-balanced silhouette, breast implants can help patients appear more youthful and feel more confident.\r\n\r\nDuring a pre-surgical consultation, Dr. Mitts discusses the different options associated with breast implant surgery, including the size and shape of the implants, the materials used, and surgical techniques.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Lift</h4>\r\nEvents such as aging, pregnancy, and significant weight fluctuation can take a toll on the appearance of the breasts. A breast lift raises and reshapes the breasts to create an attractive, youthful figure. This procedure can be performed on its own, or in conjunction with breast implant placement. As an experienced cosmetic surgeon, Dr. Mitts is able to perform breast lift surgery using several techniques, and can discuss which surgical options are best suited to your particular case during a consultation. Ultimately, a breast lift can increase a woman’s confidence, improve her figure, and help her appear younger.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Reconstruction</h4>\r\nBreast reconstruction following mastectomy can help women regain their sense of self after breast cancer. Dr. Mitts and his team are experts in several reconstructive techniques including latissimus flap, TRAM flap, and implant reconstruction. Each of these procedures offers its own unique set of benefits, and can effectively rebuild a woman’s breast and restore her confidence. Dr. Mitts works closely with the patient’s breast cancer surgeon to devise the safest, most efficient treatment plan possible.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration also gives Dr. Mitts the opportunity to perform implant reconstruction immediately after mastectomy, should the patient choose. In addition, Dr. Mitts is able to perform nipple reconstruction, a finishing touch to breast reconstruction that significantly contributes to creating a natural-looking result.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Reduction</h4>\r\nBreast reduction surgery removes excess skin, fat, and tissue from the breast area in an effort to create a well-proportioned figure for female patients. When the breasts are particularly large, women can often experience discomfort, poor posture, and diminished self-esteem. By reducing the size of the breasts, Dr. Mitts can completely transform a patient’s figure, alleviate daily aches and pains, and enhance her self-confidence. The results of breast reduction surgery often mimic a breast lift, helping patients appear more youthful, as well. Because oversized breasts sometimes lead to health problems, the cost of the breast reduction procedure may be at least partially covered by insurance.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Learn More about Breast Surgery</h2>\r\nEnhancing the size and shape of the breast can go a long way toward helping a patient feel confident about her body.

Subtle changes to areas such as the eyes, nose, chin, or neck can have a significant impact on a patient’s self-image, as well as how he or she is perceived by others. Dr. Gordon Mitts has been practicing facial plastic surgery in Bakersfield, California for more than 20 years, and understands the importance of producing natural-looking, flawless results with each procedure. By performing a variety of surgical procedures using the latest techniques, Dr. Mitts can transform a patient’s appearance, giving him or her freedom to feel confident every day. If you are interested in learning how facial plastic surgery can improve your appearance and your life, contact our Bakersfield plastic surgery practice today.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Brow lift</h2>\r\nThe shape and position of the brow provide the framework for the structure of the other facial features. Over time, however, the brow can began to sag, and wrinkles can develop between the brows and on the forehead. A brow lift, sometimes referred to as a forehead lift, tightens and removes excess skin on the forehead to effectively diminish the appearance of wrinkles and reposition the brow. In addition to eliminating signs of aging, the results of this procedure can highlight other characteristics, achieving balance and harmony among the facial features.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Latissimus Flap Reconstruction</h2>\r\nFlap reconstructive surgery refers to a method in which skin, muscle, and fat are taken from one part of the body and relocated to the chest area to create a new breast mound. During latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction, Dr. Mitts uses tissue from the latissimus dorsi – the long muscle that runs from beneath the armpit and across the back – to build a new breast. He does this by transferring the muscle and blood vessels of the latissimus dorsi to the chest area through a tunnel underneath the skin. This allows the flap to maintain its original blood supply, increasing the chances for normal sensation in the new breast.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Face Lift</h2>\r\nA number of factors such as aging, stress, and dietary habits can take a toll on the appearance of the face, causing wrinkles and sagging skin. Dr. Mitts has dedicated himself to using the most advanced surgical techniques, and performs SMAS face lift surgery, a procedure which tightens both the skin and muscles of the face to achieve a refreshed, youthful result. While traditional face lifts only alter the skin, often resulting in a “wind-blown” look, the SMAS face lift targets the deep layers of the face, creating natural, long-lasting results.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Eyelid Surgery</h2>\r\nUnder-eye bags are among the most common signs of aging and can cause individuals to constantly appear tired, stressed, or unhappy. Eyelid surgery, also known as blepharoplasty, responds to this cosmetic issue by removing excess skin and fat from the upper and lower eyelids. This delicate surgical procedure reinvigorates the eyes, and drastically improves a patient’s overall appearance. This procedure alone can help patients look more awake, alert, and engaged.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Rhinoplasty</h2>\r\nOne of the most common forms of facial plastic surgery performed at Dr. Mitts’ Bakersfield practice is rhinoplasty, or nose reshaping surgery. Because the nose is one of the most prominent facial features, its size and shape can have a tremendous impact on a patient’s overall appearance. Rhinoplasty allows Dr. Mitts to correct irregularity, crookedness, and asymmetry of the nose so that it complements other facial characteristics.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Facial Liposuction</h2>\r\nExtra fat in the face and neck can detract from a patient’s appearance, leading him or her to look aged and even unhealthy. Unfortunately, this fat cannot always be targeted by diet and other lifestyle changes. Facial liposuction is, therefore, a welcomed treatment option for patients who wish to remove unwanted fat deposits in the face. This procedure can be combined with a face lift or neck lift to refresh all of the facial features simultaneously.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Neck Lift</h2>\r\nWhen it comes to maintaining a youthful appearance, many patients are solely concerned with facial features such as the eyes, nose, and chin. It is important, however, to preserve the appearance of the neck as well, which is particularly vulnerable to wrinkles and sagging. Neck lift surgery removes fat deposits around the neck and tightens skin that has lost elasticity. This procedure can be used to respond to sun damage, eliminate a “double chin,” and sculpt a strong, attractive jaw line.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Fat Transfer</h2>\r\nWhile most facial plastic surgery procedures involve removing skin and fat, other procedures such as fat transfer use fat to enhance and restructure facial features. This revolutionary procedure, sometimes referred to as autologous fat transfer, uses fat from the patient’s own body to add volume to areas of the face that have been affected by aging and stress. This procedure is an attractive alternative to facial fillers because it typically lasts longer, and does not involve the injection of foreign materials into the body.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Contact Mitts Plastic Surgery Today</h2>\r\nDr. Mitts is dedicated to helping each of his patients feel confident and happy every time he or she looks in the mirror. He understands the importance of having a unique, attractive look and is pleased to offer a variety of procedures that can be customized to suit the cosmetic goals of all of his patients.

(4179, 392, 'doctor_content', '<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-50\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n\r\nThe facial features are the most delicate, yet most pronounced part of a patient’s appearance. Subtle changes to areas such as the eyes, nose, chin, or neck can have a significant impact on a patient’s self-image, as well as how he or she is perceived by others. Dr. Gordon Mitts has been practicing facial plastic surgery in Bakersfield, California for more than 20 years, and understands the importance of producing natural-looking, flawless results with each procedure. By performing a variety of surgical procedures using the latest techniques, Dr. Mitts can transform a patient’s appearance, giving him or her freedom to feel confident every day. If you are interested in learning how facial plastic surgery can improve your appearance and your life, contact our Bakersfield plastic surgery practice today.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Brow lift</h2>\r\nThe shape and position of the brow provide the framework for the structure of the other facial features. Over time, however, the brow can began to sag, and wrinkles can develop between the brows and on the forehead. A brow lift, sometimes referred to as a forehead lift, tightens and removes excess skin on the forehead to effectively diminish the appearance of wrinkles and reposition the brow. In addition to eliminating signs of aging, the results of this procedure can highlight other characteristics, achieving balance and harmony among the facial features.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Latissimus Flap Reconstruction</h2>\r\nFlap reconstructive surgery refers to a method in which skin, muscle, and fat are taken from one part of the body and relocated to the chest area to create a new breast mound. During latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction, Dr. Mitts uses tissue from the latissimus dorsi – the long muscle that runs from beneath the armpit and across the back – to build a new breast. He does this by transferring the muscle and blood vessels of the latissimus dorsi to the chest area through a tunnel underneath the skin. This allows the flap to maintain its original blood supply, increasing the chances for normal sensation in the new breast.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Face Lift</h2>\r\nA number of factors such as aging, stress, and dietary habits can take a toll on the appearance of the face, causing wrinkles and sagging skin. Dr. Mitts has dedicated himself to using the most advanced surgical techniques, and performs SMAS face lift surgery, a procedure which tightens both the skin and muscles of the face to achieve a refreshed, youthful result. While traditional face lifts only alter the skin, often resulting in a “wind-blown” look, the SMAS face lift targets the deep layers of the face, creating natural, long-lasting results.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Eyelid Surgery</h2>\r\nUnder-eye bags are among the most common signs of aging and can cause individuals to constantly appear tired, stressed, or unhappy. Eyelid surgery, also known as blepharoplasty, responds to this cosmetic issue by removing excess skin and fat from the upper and lower eyelids. This delicate surgical procedure reinvigorates the eyes, and drastically improves a patient’s overall appearance. This procedure alone can help patients look more awake, alert, and engaged.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Rhinoplasty</h2>\r\nOne of the most common forms of facial plastic surgery performed at Dr. Mitts’ Bakersfield practice is rhinoplasty, or nose reshaping surgery. Because the nose is one of the most prominent facial features, its size and shape can have a tremendous impact on a patient’s overall appearance. Rhinoplasty allows Dr. Mitts to correct irregularity, crookedness, and asymmetry of the nose so that it complements other facial characteristics.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Facial Liposuction</h2>\r\nExtra fat in the face and neck can detract from a patient’s appearance, leading him or her to look aged and even unhealthy. Unfortunately, this fat cannot always be targeted by diet and other lifestyle changes. Facial liposuction is, therefore, a welcomed treatment option for patients who wish to remove unwanted fat deposits in the face. This procedure can be combined with a face lift or neck lift to refresh all of the facial features simultaneously.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Neck Lift</h2>\r\nWhen it comes to maintaining a youthful appearance, many patients are solely concerned with facial features such as the eyes, nose, and chin. It is important, however, to preserve the appearance of the neck as well, which is particularly vulnerable to wrinkles and sagging. Neck lift surgery removes fat deposits around the neck and tightens skin that has lost elasticity. This procedure can be used to respond to sun damage, eliminate a “double chin,” and sculpt a strong, attractive jaw line.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Fat Transfer</h2>\r\nWhile most facial plastic surgery procedures involve removing skin and fat, other procedures such as fat transfer use fat to enhance and restructure facial features. This revolutionary procedure, sometimes referred to as autologous fat transfer, uses fat from the patient’s own body to add volume to areas of the face that have been affected by aging and stress. This procedure is an attractive alternative to facial fillers because it typically lasts longer, and does not involve the injection of foreign materials into the body.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Contact Mitts Plastic Surgery Today</h2>\r\nDr. Mitts is dedicated to helping each of his patients feel confident and happy every time he or she looks in the mirror. He understands the importance of having a unique, attractive look and is pleased to offer a variety of procedures that can be customized to suit the cosmetic goals of all of his patients. If you have considered making changes to the appearance of your face, we encourage you to learn more about the facial plastic surgery procedures offered at our Bakersfield practice serving Bakersfield and Tulare County.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>'),

(4473, 424, 'doctor_content', 'Losing a breast to cancer or other illness represents a difficult transition for any woman, both emotionally and physically. At Mitts Plastic Surgery serving Bakersfield and Tulare County, cosmetic surgeon Gordon Mitts sympathizes with patients who have lost one or both of their breasts, and is committed to helping them recover as quickly and comfortably as possible.\r\n\r\nHe performs breast reconstruction for his Bakersfield, California patients in an effort to restore the appearance of their breasts, renew their self-confidence, and help them begin to put the disease in the past. If you have undergone or plan to undergo mastectomy, contact our Bakersfield practice to learn about your options for breast reconstruction.\r\n<h2>What Is Breast Reconstruction?</h2>\r\nBreast reconstruction is a complex procedure that seeks to restore the appearance of one or both breasts following mastectomy. Many women choose to undergo this surgery as a step toward returning to normalcy after breast cancer or another serious illness. Reconstructive surgery can be performed concurrently with mastectomy or at a later date, depending on the patient’s preferences. In an effort to provide the most convenient care possible for his patients, Dr. Mitts works directly with breast cancer surgeons to perform reconstruction and achieve optimal results. While no reconstructive surgery can exactly replicate the original breast, advanced techniques allow Dr. Mitts to create new breasts that look and feel natural.\r\n\r\nThere are several techniques available for performing breast reconstruction; the technique best suited to you will depend on your health history and personal preferences. Dr. Mitts and his staff understand that the decision to undergo reconstructive surgery is a major one, and they will work with you to educate you on the risks and benefits of various surgical options. Some of the reconstructive surgeries that Dr. Mitts performs include:\r\n<h4>Latissimus Flap Reconstruction</h4>\r\nFlap reconstructive surgery refers to a method in which skin, muscle, and fat are taken from one part of the body and relocated to the chest area to create a new breast mound. During latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction, Dr. Mitts uses tissue from the latissimus dorsi – the long muscle that runs from beneath the armpit and across the back – to build a new breast. He does this by transferring the muscle and blood vessels of the latissimus dorsi to the chest area through a tunnel underneath the skin. This allows the flap to maintain its original blood supply, increasing the chances for normal sensation in the new breast.\r\n<h4>TRAM Flap Reconstruction</h4>\r\nTRAM (transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) flap breast reconstruction is similar to latissimus flap surgery, except that in this procedure Dr. Mitts harvests tissue from the lower abdomen to create a new breast. Flap reconstruction creates two surgical sites, making it more complex than implant reconstruction. However, many patients prefer this form of breast reconstruction because it creates a natural-feeling breast, and does not involve the insertion of any foreign objects in the body.\r\n<h4>Breast Implants</h4>\r\nAnother breast reconstruction option for Dr. Mitts’ Bakersfield patients involves the use of breast implants. In many cases, Dr. Mitts is able to place breast implants at the same time as the mastectomy. This allows women to avoid the physical and emotional discomfort associated with not having a breast. While some women can receive silicone or saline implants immediately, others may require a tissue expander to be placed in the chest. If needed, this expander will be periodically injected with a saline solution to stretch the skin and make room for an implant to be placed during a later procedure.\r\n<h4>Breast Reduction</h4>\r\nBreast reduction surgery removes excess skin, fat, and tissue from the breast area in an effort to create a well-proportioned figure for female patients. When the breasts are particularly large, women can often experience discomfort, poor posture, and diminished self-esteem. By reducing the size of the breasts, Dr. Mitts can completely transform a patient’s figure, alleviate daily aches and pains, and enhance her self-confidence. The results of breast reduction surgery often mimic a breast lift, helping patients appear more youthful, as well. Because oversized breasts sometimes lead to health problems, the cost of the breast reduction procedure may be at least partially covered by insurance.\r\n<h2>Nipple Reconstruction</h2>\r\nNipple reconstruction is a secondary breast reconstruction surgery that is performed in an effort to enhance the appearance of the breast following the initial reconstructive procedure. This is typically performed on an outpatient basis, but may take place in a hospital depending on the type of nipple reconstruction being performed. For the most natural-looking results, Dr. Mitts recreates the nipple using the patient’s own tissue. Patients can also choose to have the areola reconstructed either through use of their own skin or a tattoo.\r\n<h2>Benefits of Breast Reconstruction</h2>\r\nWith more than 23 years of experience as a cosmetic surgeon, Dr. Mitts has helped thousands of women feel whole again through breast reconstruction procedures. He and his staff are completely invested in helping you get the results you deserve and reclaim your life after cancer.

For many patients, however, stubborn areas of fat can lead to feelings of self-doubt and hold them back from achieving their ideal body. Cosmetic surgeon Gordon Mitts understands how frustrating this can be and is pleased to offer sophisticated body sculpting procedures such as ultrasonic liposuction to his Bakersfield, California patients. With this minimally invasive yet highly effective technique, patients can obtain the shapely, attractive figures they’ve always dreamed of having. Contact our Bakersfield plastic surgery practice today to learn more about the benefits of ultrasonic liposuction.\r\n<h2>What is Ultrasonic Liposuction?</h2>\r\nUltrasonic liposuction is a unique body sculpting procedure that uses sound waves to break apart pockets of fat and easily remove them from the body. Because ultrasonic liposuction liquefies fat before eliminating it, the procedure is considerably less-invasive than other liposuction methods which manually break up fat using a surgical instrument. This form of liposuction can be used on several areas of the body, and is particularly effective for areas of dense fat. Dr. Mitts is pleased to offer both internal and external ultrasonic liposuction at his Bakersfield, California practice. During internal ultrasonic liposuction, high energy sound waves are applied beneath the skin to targeted areas of fat through a thin vacuum-like tube known as a cannula. The cannula simultaneously applies the ultrasonic energy and suctions fat from the body. Alternatively, external ultrasonic liposuction applies the ultrasonic energy on the skin’s surface. While internal ultrasonic liposuction is often the preferred method, external methods may be ideal for certain areas of the body. During a comprehensive consultation, Dr. Mitts will discuss your candidacy for the procedure, as well as which method may be best for you.\r\n<h2>Ultrasonic Liposuction and Fat Grafting</h2>\r\nAlthough most patients are solely concerned with removing fat from the body, fat grafting is a cosmetic procedure which can improve patient appearances by strategically adding fat to areas of the body that have lost volume and elasticity. Dr. Gordon Mitts offers facial fat grafting which can restore volume to the facial features, helping patients appear youthful and vibrant. This procedure involves the removal of fat from one area of the body, and placing it into targeted areas of the face. Facial fat grafting can be performed as an alternative to some of the non-surgical facial treatments offered at our Bakersfield practice. Ultrasonic liposuction has been shown to be an ideal method for harvesting fat from other areas of the body, with nearly 80 percent of fat removed deemed usable for grafting.\r\n<h2>The Benefit of Ultrasonic Liposuction</h2>\r\nUltrasonic liposuction carries the same benefits as traditional liposuction, but offers its own set of advantages as well. One of the main benefits of ultrasonic liposuction\r\n\r\nis that is considerably less-invasive than traditional liposuction because the fat is liquefied before it is removed from the body. This results in a more gentle procedure, reduced instance of scarring, and faster healing time. Another benefit of ultrasonic liposuction is that the procedure can be used to target fat in several areas of the body. While the procedure is gentle enough to treat areas such as the chin, neck, and arms, it is effective enough to remove fat from the stomach and chest. Because the sound waves liquefy fat prior to removal, ultrasonic liposuction is ideal for particularly dense pockets of fat as well. This makes ultrasonic liposuction a viable alternative to more extensive procedures such as abdominoplasty. Patients who undergo ultrasonic liposuction also find that the skin is tightened during the procedure, eliminating the need for any “fine-tuning” procedures after surgery.\r\n\r\nSome other benefits of ultrasonic liposuction include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Improved appearance</li>\r\n 	<li>Increased self-confidence</li>\r\n 	<li>Health benefits as a result of fat loss</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Contact Mitts Plastic Surgery Today</h2>\r\nDr. Gordon Mitts is dedicated to providing advanced surgical treatments that are safe and effective so his patients can enjoy the body they’ve always wanted.

For many patients, however, stubborn areas of fat can lead to feelings of self-doubt and hold them back from achieving their ideal body. Cosmetic surgeon Gordon Mitts understands how frustrating this can be and is pleased to offer sophisticated body sculpting procedures such as ultrasonic liposuction to his Bakersfield, California patients. With this minimally invasive yet highly effective technique, patients can obtain the shapely, attractive figures they’ve always dreamed of having. Contact our Bakersfield plastic surgery practice today to learn more about the benefits of ultrasonic liposuction.\r\n<h2>What is Ultrasonic Liposuction?</h2>\r\nUltrasonic liposuction is a unique body sculpting procedure that uses sound waves to break apart pockets of fat and easily remove them from the body. Because ultrasonic liposuction liquefies fat before eliminating it, the procedure is considerably less-invasive than other liposuction methods which manually break up fat using a surgical instrument. This form of liposuction can be used on several areas of the body, and is particularly effective for areas of dense fat. Dr. Mitts is pleased to offer both internal and external ultrasonic liposuction at his Bakersfield, California practice. During internal ultrasonic liposuction, high energy sound waves are applied beneath the skin to targeted areas of fat through a thin vacuum-like tube known as a cannula. The cannula simultaneously applies the ultrasonic energy and suctions fat from the body. Alternatively, external ultrasonic liposuction applies the ultrasonic energy on the skin’s surface. While internal ultrasonic liposuction is often the preferred method, external methods may be ideal for certain areas of the body. During a comprehensive consultation, Dr. Mitts will discuss your candidacy for the procedure, as well as which method may be best for you.\r\n<h2>Ultrasonic Liposuction and Fat Grafting</h2>\r\nAlthough most patients are solely concerned with removing fat from the body, fat grafting is a cosmetic procedure which can improve patient appearances by strategically adding fat to areas of the body that have lost volume and elasticity.

Dr. Gordon Mitts offers facial fat grafting which can restore volume to the facial features, helping patients appear youthful and vibrant. This procedure involves the removal of fat from one area of the body, and placing it into targeted areas of the face. Facial fat grafting can be performed as an alternative to some of the non-surgical facial treatments offered at our Bakersfield practice. Ultrasonic liposuction has been shown to be an ideal method for harvesting fat from other areas of the body, with nearly 80 percent of fat removed deemed usable for grafting.'),

One of the main benefits of ultrasonic liposuction\r\n\r\nis that is considerably less-invasive than traditional liposuction because the fat is liquefied before it is removed from the body. This results in a more gentle procedure, reduced instance of scarring, and faster healing time. Another benefit of ultrasonic liposuction is that the procedure can be used to target fat in several areas of the body. While the procedure is gentle enough to treat areas such as the chin, neck, and arms, it is effective enough to remove fat from the stomach and chest. Because the sound waves liquefy fat prior to removal, ultrasonic liposuction is ideal for particularly dense pockets of fat as well. This makes ultrasonic liposuction a viable alternative to more extensive procedures such as abdominoplasty. Patients who undergo ultrasonic liposuction also find that the skin is tightened during the procedure, eliminating the need for any “fine-tuning” procedures after surgery.\r\n\r\nSome other benefits of ultrasonic liposuction include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Improved appearance</li>\r\n 	<li>Increased self-confidence</li>\r\n 	<li>Health benefits as a result of fat loss</li>\r\n</ul>'),

He understands that many individuals are unhappy with certain aspects of their appearance, and takes great pride in his ability to help patients achieve their cosmetic goals. Dr. Mitts gets to know his patients as individuals so that he can fully understand their unique needs and desires. This dedication to the highest level of patient care, coupled with the use of the latest treatment techniques and tools, has allowed Dr. Mitts to achieve stunning cosmetic results for patients for more than 20 years. By offering a wide range of body sculpting treatments at his Bakersfield , California practice, Dr. Mitts gives all of his patients the opportunity to have the body of their dreams.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in enhancing your appearance through body contouring procedures, contact Mitts Plastic Surgery serving Bakersfield and Tulare County today to see for yourself how the friendly, individualized care from Dr. Mitts and his staff can help you make your ideal body a reality.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Liposuction</h2>\r\nDr. Mitts strives to offer the most advanced and effective, least invasive body sculpting treatments to his Bakersfield patients. He is pleased to perform both internal and external ultrasonic liposuction. Like traditional liposuction, ultrasonic liposuction removes unwanted fat from several areas of the body. However, this advanced technique uses high-pitched sound waves to liquefy fat prior to removal, enhancing Dr. Mitts’ ability to remove particularly dense pockets of fat. Ultrasonic liposuction can simultaneously tighten the skin, making it a preferred treatment option for patients who do not want to undergo multiple surgical procedures.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Tummy Tuck</h2>\r\nFor many individuals, stubborn belly fat is holding them back from their ideal body. A tummy tuck, also referred to as abdominoplasty, is a comprehensive body contouring procedure that removes fat from the abdomen and tightens underlying muscles, resulting in a sleek, attractive look. Not only can a tummy tuck help patients fit into smaller sizes, but it can also drastically improve their self-confidence. Dr. Mitts also offers the mini-tummy tuck for less of an extended scar. Call to see if you qualify for this surgery.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Thigh Lift</h2>\r\nLoose, excess skin on the upper legs can be a cause for self-consciousness, especially among women. The thigh lift procedure can eliminate fat in the thighs and tighten the skin, giving patients a slender, healthy appearance. This body sculpting procedure can target both the inner and outer thighs, and is ideal for patients who have experienced weight fluctuations. Many patients choose to combine this treatment with other procedures such as gluteal implants, or a butt lift.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Gluteal Implants</h2>\r\nDr. Mitts offers gluteal implants, also known as butt implants, to his Bakersfield patients who desire a shapely figure. Gluteal implants are made of silicone and can vary in size and shape based on individual preference. In addition to adding curves to the body, gluteal implants give patients more clothing options and help them feel confident about their shape.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>More Information on Body Sculpting</h2>\r\nWhen patients feel good about their bodies, it can enhance their lives in so many ways.

For women who are unhappy with the shape or size of their breasts, however, feeling confident on a daily basis can prove difficult. Dr. Gordon Mitts is an experienced plastic surgeon, offering a comprehensive range of breast surgery procedures to patients of his Bakersfield, California practice. Through the latest treatment techniques and a finely honed aesthetic eye, Dr. Mitts is able to produce natural-looking results that suit each patient’s individual cosmetic goals. To learn more about the breast surgery options available at Mitts plastic surgery, schedule a surgical consultation at our Bakersfield practice today.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Types of Breast Surgery</h2>\r\nAt Mitts Plastic Surgery, we offer several types of breast surgery to accommodate the various cosmetic and health-related needs of our patients. Dr. Mitts understands that no two women are exactly alike, which is why he works with each patient individually to determine her surgical goals and create an appropriate treatment plan. The breast surgery options available at his Bakersfield practice include:\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Implants</h4>\r\nDr. Mitts offers silicone and saline breast implants to patients who wish to enhance the size of their breasts. Both silicone and saline breast implants provide an aesthetically pleasing and long-lasting result. The type of breast implant that a patient receives will depend on a number of factors, including her medical history and cosmetic goals, as well as Dr. Mitts’ recommendations. By creating an attractive, well-balanced silhouette, breast implants can help patients appear more youthful and feel more confident.\r\n\r\nDuring a pre-surgical consultation, Dr. Mitts discusses the different options associated with breast implant surgery, including the size and shape of the implants, the materials used, and surgical techniques.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Lift</h4>\r\nEvents such as aging, pregnancy, and significant weight fluctuation can take a toll on the appearance of the breasts. A breast lift raises and reshapes the breasts to create an attractive, youthful figure. This procedure can be performed on its own, or in conjunction with breast implant placement. As an experienced cosmetic surgeon, Dr. Mitts is able to perform breast lift surgery using several techniques, and can discuss which surgical options are best suited to your particular case during a consultation. Ultimately, a breast lift can increase a woman’s confidence, improve her figure, and help her appear younger.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Reconstruction</h4>\r\nBreast reconstruction following mastectomy can help women regain their sense of self after breast cancer. Dr. Mitts and his team are experts in several reconstructive techniques including latissimus flap, TRAM flap, and implant reconstruction. Each of these procedures offers its own unique set of benefits, and can effectively rebuild a woman’s breast and restore her confidence. Dr. Mitts works closely with the patient’s breast cancer surgeon to devise the safest, most efficient treatment plan possible.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration also gives Dr. Mitts the opportunity to perform implant reconstruction immediately after mastectomy, should the patient choose. In addition, Dr. Mitts is able to perform nipple reconstruction, a finishing touch to breast reconstruction that significantly contributes to creating a natural-looking result.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Reduction</h4>\r\nBreast reduction surgery removes excess skin, fat, and tissue from the breast area in an effort to create a well-proportioned figure for female patients. When the breasts are particularly large, women can often experience discomfort, poor posture, and diminished self-esteem. By reducing the size of the breasts, Dr. Mitts can completely transform a patient’s figure, alleviate daily aches and pains, and enhance her self-confidence. The results of breast reduction surgery often mimic a breast lift, helping patients appear more youthful, as well. Because oversized breasts sometimes lead to health problems, the cost of the breast reduction procedure may be at least partially covered by insurance.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Learn More about Breast Surgery</h2>\r\nEnhancing the size and shape of the breast can go a long way toward helping a patient feel confident about her body. Additionally, breast reconstruction surgery following mastectomy has priceless benefits. Dr. Mitts is proud to offer breast surgery at his Bakersfield, California practice because he understands the positive impact that these procedures can have. If you have been considering breast surgery and would like to learn more about the procedures offered at our cosmetic surgery practice, please contact us today.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>'),

Subtle changes to areas such as the eyes, nose, chin, or neck can have a significant impact on a patient’s self-image, as well as how he or she is perceived by others. Dr. Gordon Mitts has been practicing facial plastic surgery in Bakersfield, California for more than 20 years, and understands the importance of producing natural-looking, flawless results with each procedure.

Over time, however, the brow can began to sag, and wrinkles can develop between the brows and on the forehead. A brow lift, sometimes referred to as a forehead lift, tightens and removes excess skin on the forehead to effectively diminish the appearance of wrinkles and reposition the brow. In addition to eliminating signs of aging, the results of this procedure can highlight other characteristics, achieving balance and harmony among the facial features.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Latissimus Flap Reconstruction</h2>\r\nFlap reconstructive surgery refers to a method in which skin, muscle, and fat are taken from one part of the body and relocated to the chest area to create a new breast mound. During latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction, Dr. Mitts uses tissue from the latissimus dorsi – the long muscle that runs from beneath the armpit and across the back – to build a new breast. He does this by transferring the muscle and blood vessels of the latissimus dorsi to the chest area through a tunnel underneath the skin. This allows the flap to maintain its original blood supply, increasing the chances for normal sensation in the new breast.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Face Lift</h2>\r\nA number of factors such as aging, stress, and dietary habits can take a toll on the appearance of the face, causing wrinkles and sagging skin. Dr. Mitts has dedicated himself to using the most advanced surgical techniques, and performs SMAS face lift surgery, a procedure which tightens both the skin and muscles of the face to achieve a refreshed, youthful result. While traditional face lifts only alter the skin, often resulting in a “wind-blown” look, the SMAS face lift targets the deep layers of the face, creating natural, long-lasting results.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Eyelid Surgery</h2>\r\nUnder-eye bags are among the most common signs of aging and can cause individuals to constantly appear tired, stressed, or unhappy. Eyelid surgery, also known as blepharoplasty, responds to this cosmetic issue by removing excess skin and fat from the upper and lower eyelids. This delicate surgical procedure reinvigorates the eyes, and drastically improves a patient’s overall appearance. This procedure alone can help patients look more awake, alert, and engaged.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Rhinoplasty</h2>\r\nOne of the most common forms of facial plastic surgery performed at Dr. Mitts’ Bakersfield practice is rhinoplasty, or nose reshaping surgery. Because the nose is one of the most prominent facial features, its size and shape can have a tremendous impact on a patient’s overall appearance. Rhinoplasty allows Dr. Mitts to correct irregularity, crookedness, and asymmetry of the nose so that it complements other facial characteristics.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Facial Liposuction</h2>\r\nExtra fat in the face and neck can detract from a patient’s appearance, leading him or her to look aged and even unhealthy. Unfortunately, this fat cannot always be targeted by diet and other lifestyle changes. Facial liposuction is, therefore, a welcomed treatment option for patients who wish to remove unwanted fat deposits in the face. This procedure can be combined with a face lift or neck lift to refresh all of the facial features simultaneously.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Neck Lift</h2>\r\nWhen it comes to maintaining a youthful appearance, many patients are solely concerned with facial features such as the eyes, nose, and chin. It is important, however, to preserve the appearance of the neck as well, which is particularly vulnerable to wrinkles and sagging. Neck lift surgery removes fat deposits around the neck and tightens skin that has lost elasticity. This procedure can be used to respond to sun damage, eliminate a “double chin,” and sculpt a strong, attractive jaw line.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Fat Transfer</h2>\r\nWhile most facial plastic surgery procedures involve removing skin and fat, other procedures such as fat transfer use fat to enhance and restructure facial features. This revolutionary procedure, sometimes referred to as autologous fat transfer, uses fat from the patient’s own body to add volume to areas of the face that have been affected by aging and stress. This procedure is an attractive alternative to facial fillers because it typically lasts longer, and does not involve the injection of foreign materials into the body.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Contact Mitts Plastic Surgery Today</h2>\r\nDr. Mitts is dedicated to helping each of his patients feel confident and happy every time he or she looks in the mirror. He understands the importance of having a unique, attractive look and is pleased to offer a variety of procedures that can be customized to suit the cosmetic goals of all of his patients.

This doesn’t mean, however, that he or she has to put up with cosmetic imperfections. As part of his commitment to help all of his patients look their best, Dr. Gordon Mitts offers several non-surgical treatments. These minimally invasive options, including lip injections, BOTOX® Cosmetic, and facial peels, are ideal for Dr. Mitts’ Bakersfield patients who desire a noticeable change without taking having to undergo surgery.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the non-surgical cosmetic options available at Mitts Plastic Surgery, contact our Bakersfield practice today.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Facial Peels</h2>\r\nDr. Mitts administers facial peels to his patients who wish to repair and revive dull skin. Chemical peels can be used to treat uneven pigmentation, acne, dry skin, sun damage, and even fine lines. These treatments can be administered in one easy office visit, and provide patients with smooth, unblemished skin. Dr. Mitts performs two main facial peels at his Bakersfield practice:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Glycolic acid is known as an alpha hydroxyl acid, and is derived from sugar cane. Dr. Mitts uses these types of peels to respond to mild scarring, wrinkles, and skin imperfections. In addition, glycolic acid peels are excellent exfoliants, and can be used to unclog pores and combat acne.</li>\r\n 	<li>Trichloric acid peels (TCA) are more in-depth than their glycolic counterparts and target deeper layers of the skin for more drastic results. Dr. Mitts will create a customized concentration of the solution and apply it either to the entire face or to targeted areas. In the days following treatment, the damaged top layer of the skin peels away to reveal brighter, vibrant skin.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Injectable Treatments</h2>\r\nAs a natural part of aging, the skin can lose volume and elasticity, causing patients to appear older and even worn down. With advanced cosmetic treatments, however, you don’t have to give in to signs of aging. Dr. Mitts is pleased to offer injectables treatments that are placed beneath the skin to add volume, eliminate wrinkles, and help patients appear youthful and refreshed. These injections can produce results similar to surgical treatments such as a face lift or brow lift, but can be completed in less than one hour. Among the injectable treatments offered at our Bakersfield practice are JUVÉDERM®, BOTOX® Cosmetic, Artefill®, fat grafting, and The latest in facial treatment the Vampire face lift. We can help you with all those small wrinkles by using the latest in laserTreatment\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Lip Injections</h2>\r\nIn addition to facial injections to reduce signs of aging, Dr. Mitts offers injectable lip treatments that can give patients full, attractive lips. These injections can consist of fat grafting or hyaluronic acid, depending on patient preferences and cosmetic goals. Results of lip injections can be seen immediately and can last several months.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Schedule a Consultation Today</h2>\r\nEven patients who are apprehensive about undergoing plastic surgery can experience the benefits of treatment from Dr. Mitts.

He uses the most effective, state-of-the-art treatments at Mitts Plastic Surgery, such as the SMAS face-lift that targets underlying muscle for a natural-looking result, and minimally invasive ultrasonic liposuction that aids fat removal.\r\n\r\nDr. Mitts and his team want to help you feel happier, healthier, and more confident so you can enjoy your life to the fullest, and they pride themselves on providing both excellent patient care and refined aesthetic results.'),

Dr. Mitts and his aesthetician, Lisa Murphy, RN, aim to provide every patient with the highest quality treatment and care, and the clinic bases its ethos on helping patients achieve their cosmetic and reconstructive goals.\r\n\r\nDr. Mitts comes from a family of physicians, including his father and two uncles, and after graduating from La Sierra University in Riverside, California, he pursued his own calling into the field of medicine. He obtained his medical degree from Loma Linda University Medical Center, California, and gained extensive experience in a series of surgical residency positions before opening Mitts Plastic Surgery in Bakersfield.\r\n\r\nDr. Mitts understands the importance of educating himself on the most advanced treatment options available and the latest technological developments to optimize the patient experience and increase patient comfort and safety while reducing healing time. He uses the most effective, state-of-the-art treatments at Mitts Plastic Surgery, such as the SMAS face-lift that targets underlying muscle for a natural-looking result, and minimally invasive ultrasonic liposuction that aids fat removal.\r\n\r\nDr. Mitts and his team want to help you feel happier, healthier, and more confident so you can enjoy your life to the fullest, and they pride themselves on providing both excellent patient care and refined aesthetic results.'),

For women who are unhappy with the shape or size of their breasts, however, feeling confident on a daily basis can prove difficult. Dr. Gordon Mitts is an experienced plastic surgeon, offering a comprehensive range of breast surgery procedures to patients of his Bakersfield, California practice. Through the latest treatment techniques and a finely honed aesthetic eye, Dr. Mitts is able to produce natural-looking results that suit each patient’s individual cosmetic goals. To learn more about the breast surgery options available at Mitts plastic surgery, schedule a surgical consultation at our Bakersfield practice today.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Types of Breast Surgery</h2>\r\nAt Mitts Plastic Surgery, we offer several types of breast surgery to accommodate the various cosmetic and health-related needs of our patients. Dr. Mitts understands that no two women are exactly alike, which is why he works with each patient individually to determine her surgical goals and create an appropriate treatment plan. The breast surgery options available at his Bakersfield practice include:\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Implants</h4>\r\nDr. Mitts offers silicone and saline breast implants to patients who wish to enhance the size of their breasts. Both silicone and saline breast implants provide an aesthetically pleasing and long-lasting result. The type of breast implant that a patient receives will depend on a number of factors, including her medical history and cosmetic goals, as well as Dr. Mitts’ recommendations. By creating an attractive, well-balanced silhouette, breast implants can help patients appear more youthful and feel more confident.\r\n\r\nDuring a pre-surgical consultation, Dr. Mitts discusses the different options associated with breast implant surgery, including the size and shape of the implants, the materials used, and surgical techniques.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Lift</h4>\r\nEvents such as aging, pregnancy, and significant weight fluctuation can take a toll on the appearance of the breasts. A breast lift raises and reshapes the breasts to create an attractive, youthful figure. This procedure can be performed on its own, or in conjunction with breast implant placement. As an experienced cosmetic surgeon, Dr. Mitts is able to perform breast lift surgery using several techniques, and can discuss which surgical options are best suited to your particular case during a consultation. Ultimately, a breast lift can increase a woman’s confidence, improve her figure, and help her appear younger.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Reconstruction</h4>\r\nBreast reconstruction following mastectomy can help women regain their sense of self after breast cancer. Dr. Mitts and his team are experts in several reconstructive techniques including latissimus flap, TRAM flap, and implant reconstruction. Each of these procedures offers its own unique set of benefits, and can effectively rebuild a woman’s breast and restore her confidence. Dr. Mitts works closely with the patient’s breast cancer surgeon to devise the safest, most efficient treatment plan possible.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration also gives Dr. Mitts the opportunity to perform implant reconstruction immediately after mastectomy, should the patient choose. In addition, Dr. Mitts is able to perform nipple reconstruction, a finishing touch to breast reconstruction that significantly contributes to creating a natural-looking result.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Reduction</h4>\r\nBreast reduction surgery removes excess skin, fat, and tissue from the breast area in an effort to create a well-proportioned figure for female patients. When the breasts are particularly large, women can often experience discomfort, poor posture, and diminished self-esteem. By reducing the size of the breasts, Dr. Mitts can completely transform a patient’s figure, alleviate daily aches and pains, and enhance her self-confidence. The results of breast reduction surgery often mimic a breast lift, helping patients appear more youthful, as well. Because oversized breasts sometimes lead to health problems, the cost of the breast reduction procedure may be at least partially covered by insurance.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Learn More about Breast Surgery</h2>\r\nEnhancing the size and shape of the breast can go a long way toward helping a patient feel confident about her body.

Subtle changes to areas such as the eyes, nose, chin, or neck can have a significant impact on a patient’s self-image, as well as how he or she is perceived by others. Dr. Gordon Mitts has been practicing facial plastic surgery in Bakersfield, California for more than 20 years, and understands the importance of producing natural-looking, flawless results with each procedure.

Over time, however, the brow can began to sag, and wrinkles can develop between the brows and on the forehead. A brow lift, sometimes referred to as a forehead lift, tightens and removes excess skin on the forehead to effectively diminish the appearance of wrinkles and reposition the brow. In addition to eliminating signs of aging, the results of this procedure can highlight other characteristics, achieving balance and harmony among the facial features.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Latissimus Flap Reconstruction</h2>\r\nFlap reconstructive surgery refers to a method in which skin, muscle, and fat are taken from one part of the body and relocated to the chest area to create a new breast mound. During latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction, Dr. Mitts uses tissue from the latissimus dorsi – the long muscle that runs from beneath the armpit and across the back – to build a new breast. He does this by transferring the muscle and blood vessels of the latissimus dorsi to the chest area through a tunnel underneath the skin. This allows the flap to maintain its original blood supply, increasing the chances for normal sensation in the new breast.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Face Lift</h2>\r\nA number of factors such as aging, stress, and dietary habits can take a toll on the appearance of the face, causing wrinkles and sagging skin. Dr. Mitts has dedicated himself to using the most advanced surgical techniques, and performs SMAS face lift surgery, a procedure which tightens both the skin and muscles of the face to achieve a refreshed, youthful result. While traditional face lifts only alter the skin, often resulting in a “wind-blown” look, the SMAS face lift targets the deep layers of the face, creating natural, long-lasting results.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Eyelid Surgery</h2>\r\nUnder-eye bags are among the most common signs of aging and can cause individuals to constantly appear tired, stressed, or unhappy. Eyelid surgery, also known as blepharoplasty, responds to this cosmetic issue by removing excess skin and fat from the upper and lower eyelids. This delicate surgical procedure reinvigorates the eyes, and drastically improves a patient’s overall appearance. This procedure alone can help patients look more awake, alert, and engaged.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Rhinoplasty</h2>\r\nOne of the most common forms of facial plastic surgery performed at Dr. Mitts’ Bakersfield practice is rhinoplasty, or nose reshaping surgery. Because the nose is one of the most prominent facial features, its size and shape can have a tremendous impact on a patient’s overall appearance. Rhinoplasty allows Dr. Mitts to correct irregularity, crookedness, and asymmetry of the nose so that it complements other facial characteristics.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Facial Liposuction</h2>\r\nExtra fat in the face and neck can detract from a patient’s appearance, leading him or her to look aged and even unhealthy. Unfortunately, this fat cannot always be targeted by diet and other lifestyle changes. Facial liposuction is, therefore, a welcomed treatment option for patients who wish to remove unwanted fat deposits in the face. This procedure can be combined with a face lift or neck lift to refresh all of the facial features simultaneously.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Neck Lift</h2>\r\nWhen it comes to maintaining a youthful appearance, many patients are solely concerned with facial features such as the eyes, nose, and chin. It is important, however, to preserve the appearance of the neck as well, which is particularly vulnerable to wrinkles and sagging. Neck lift surgery removes fat deposits around the neck and tightens skin that has lost elasticity. This procedure can be used to respond to sun damage, eliminate a “double chin,” and sculpt a strong, attractive jaw line.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Fat Transfer</h2>\r\nWhile most facial plastic surgery procedures involve removing skin and fat, other procedures such as fat transfer use fat to enhance and restructure facial features. This revolutionary procedure, sometimes referred to as autologous fat transfer, uses fat from the patient’s own body to add volume to areas of the face that have been affected by aging and stress. This procedure is an attractive alternative to facial fillers because it typically lasts longer, and does not involve the injection of foreign materials into the body.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Contact Mitts Plastic Surgery Today</h2>\r\nDr. Mitts is dedicated to helping each of his patients feel confident and happy every time he or she looks in the mirror. He understands the importance of having a unique, attractive look and is pleased to offer a variety of procedures that can be customized to suit the cosmetic goals of all of his patients. If you have considered making changes to the appearance of your face, we encourage you to learn more about the facial plastic surgery procedures offered at our Bakersfield practice serving Bakersfield and Tulare County.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>'),

Dr. Mitts will create a customized concentration of the solution and apply it either to the entire face or to targeted areas. In the days following treatment, the damaged top layer of the skin peels away to reveal brighter, vibrant skin.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Injectable Treatments</h2>\r\nAs a natural part of aging, the skin can lose volume and elasticity, causing patients to appear older and even worn down.

Dr. Mitts offers several injectable treatments including JUVÉDERM®, Artefill®, and BOTOX® Cosmetic at his Bakersfield practice. These injections are placed beneath the skin to restore volume and elasticity. While they all serve same goal, each works differently to produce ideal results for every patient.\r\n\r\nJUVÉDERM® is a gel-based filler that is proven to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines for up to one year. It works by replenishing the body’s hyaluronic acid, the substance that adds moisture and volume to the skin. JUVÉDERM® can be used to target smile lines, marionette lines, and vertical lines beneath the nose.\r\n\r\nArtefill® is an injectable treatment that works with your body’s own collagen to provide long-lasting support for your skin. This treatment is ideal for the treatment of facial folds around the nose and mouth. Results are apparent immediately, and can continue to improve in the months following treatment.\r\n\r\nBOTOX® Cosmetic is one of the most popular injectable treatments available today. BOTOX® Cosmetic is injected into the muscle and works differently from facial fillers in that it inhibits muscle contractions to reduce the appearance and formation of wrinkles between the brows.'),

For women who are unhappy with the shape or size of their breasts, however, feeling confident on a daily basis can prove difficult. Dr. Gordon Mitts is an experienced plastic surgeon, offering a comprehensive range of breast surgery procedures to patients of his Bakersfield, California practice. Through the latest treatment techniques and a finely honed aesthetic eye, Dr. Mitts is able to produce natural-looking results that suit each patient’s individual cosmetic goals. To learn more about the breast surgery options available at Mitts plastic surgery, schedule a surgical consultation at our Bakersfield practice today.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Types of Breast Surgery</h2>\r\nAt Mitts Plastic Surgery, we offer several types of breast surgery to accommodate the various cosmetic and health-related needs of our patients. Dr. Mitts understands that no two women are exactly alike, which is why he works with each patient individually to determine her surgical goals and create an appropriate treatment plan. The breast surgery options available at his Bakersfield practice include:\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Implants</h4>\r\nDr. Mitts offers silicone and saline breast implants to patients who wish to enhance the size of their breasts. Both silicone and saline breast implants provide an aesthetically pleasing and long-lasting result. The type of breast implant that a patient receives will depend on a number of factors, including her medical history and cosmetic goals, as well as Dr. Mitts’ recommendations. By creating an attractive, well-balanced silhouette, breast implants can help patients appear more youthful and feel more confident.\r\n\r\nDuring a pre-surgical consultation, Dr. Mitts discusses the different options associated with breast implant surgery, including the size and shape of the implants, the materials used, and surgical techniques.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Lift</h4>\r\nEvents such as aging, pregnancy, and significant weight fluctuation can take a toll on the appearance of the breasts. A breast lift raises and reshapes the breasts to create an attractive, youthful figure. This procedure can be performed on its own, or in conjunction with breast implant placement. As an experienced cosmetic surgeon, Dr. Mitts is able to perform breast lift surgery using several techniques, and can discuss which surgical options are best suited to your particular case during a consultation. Ultimately, a breast lift can increase a woman’s confidence, improve her figure, and help her appear younger.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Reconstruction</h4>\r\nBreast reconstruction following mastectomy can help women regain their sense of self after breast cancer. Dr. Mitts and his team are experts in several reconstructive techniques including latissimus flap, TRAM flap, and implant reconstruction. Each of these procedures offers its own unique set of benefits, and can effectively rebuild a woman’s breast and restore her confidence. Dr. Mitts works closely with the patient’s breast cancer surgeon to devise the safest, most efficient treatment plan possible.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration also gives Dr. Mitts the opportunity to perform implant reconstruction immediately after mastectomy, should the patient choose. In addition, Dr. Mitts is able to perform nipple reconstruction, a finishing touch to breast reconstruction that significantly contributes to creating a natural-looking result.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h4>Breast Reduction</h4>\r\nBreast reduction surgery removes excess skin, fat, and tissue from the breast area in an effort to create a well-proportioned figure for female patients. When the breasts are particularly large, women can often experience discomfort, poor posture, and diminished self-esteem. By reducing the size of the breasts, Dr. Mitts can completely transform a patient’s figure, alleviate daily aches and pains, and enhance her self-confidence. The results of breast reduction surgery often mimic a breast lift, helping patients appear more youthful, as well. Because oversized breasts sometimes lead to health problems, the cost of the breast reduction procedure may be at least partially covered by insurance.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Learn More about Breast Surgery</h2>\r\nEnhancing the size and shape of the breast can go a long way toward helping a patient feel confident about her body. Additionally, breast reconstruction surgery following mastectomy has priceless benefits. Dr. Mitts is proud to offer breast surgery at his Bakersfield, California practice because he understands the positive impact that these procedures can have. If you have been considering breast surgery and would like to learn more about the procedures offered at our cosmetic surgery practice, please contact us today.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>'),

(7777, 658, 'doctor_content', '<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-50\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n\r\nThe facial features are the most delicate, yet most pronounced part of a patient’s appearance. Subtle changes to areas such as the eyes, nose, chin, or neck can have a significant impact on a patient’s self-image, as well as how he or she is perceived by others. Dr. Gordon Mitts has been practicing facial plastic surgery in Bakersfield, California for more than 20 years, and understands the importance of producing natural-looking, flawless results with each procedure. By performing a variety of surgical procedures using the latest techniques, Dr. Mitts can transform a patient’s appearance, giving him or her freedom to feel confident every day. If you are interested in learning how facial plastic surgery can improve your appearance and your life, contact our Bakersfield plastic surgery practice today.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Brow lift</h2>\r\nThe shape and position of the brow provide the framework for the structure of the other facial features. Over time, however, the brow can began to sag, and wrinkles can develop between the brows and on the forehead. A brow lift, sometimes referred to as a forehead lift, tightens and removes excess skin on the forehead to effectively diminish the appearance of wrinkles and reposition the brow. In addition to eliminating signs of aging, the results of this procedure can highlight other characteristics, achieving balance and harmony among the facial features.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Latissimus Flap Reconstruction</h2>\r\nFlap reconstructive surgery refers to a method in which skin, muscle, and fat are taken from one part of the body and relocated to the chest area to create a new breast mound. During latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction, Dr. Mitts uses tissue from the latissimus dorsi – the long muscle that runs from beneath the armpit and across the back – to build a new breast. He does this by transferring the muscle and blood vessels of the latissimus dorsi to the chest area through a tunnel underneath the skin. This allows the flap to maintain its original blood supply, increasing the chances for normal sensation in the new breast.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Face Lift</h2>\r\nA number of factors such as aging, stress, and dietary habits can take a toll on the appearance of the face, causing wrinkles and sagging skin. Dr. Mitts has dedicated himself to using the most advanced surgical techniques, and performs SMAS face lift surgery, a procedure which tightens both the skin and muscles of the face to achieve a refreshed, youthful result. While traditional face lifts only alter the skin, often resulting in a “wind-blown” look, the SMAS face lift targets the deep layers of the face, creating natural, long-lasting results.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Eyelid Surgery</h2>\r\nUnder-eye bags are among the most common signs of aging and can cause individuals to constantly appear tired, stressed, or unhappy. Eyelid surgery, also known as blepharoplasty, responds to this cosmetic issue by removing excess skin and fat from the upper and lower eyelids. This delicate surgical procedure reinvigorates the eyes, and drastically improves a patient’s overall appearance. This procedure alone can help patients look more awake, alert, and engaged.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Rhinoplasty</h2>\r\nOne of the most common forms of facial plastic surgery performed at Dr. Mitts’ Bakersfield practice is rhinoplasty, or nose reshaping surgery. Because the nose is one of the most prominent facial features, its size and shape can have a tremendous impact on a patient’s overall appearance. Rhinoplasty allows Dr. Mitts to correct irregularity, crookedness, and asymmetry of the nose so that it complements other facial characteristics.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Facial Liposuction</h2>\r\nExtra fat in the face and neck can detract from a patient’s appearance, leading him or her to look aged and even unhealthy. Unfortunately, this fat cannot always be targeted by diet and other lifestyle changes. Facial liposuction is, therefore, a welcomed treatment option for patients who wish to remove unwanted fat deposits in the face. This procedure can be combined with a face lift or neck lift to refresh all of the facial features simultaneously.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Neck Lift</h2>\r\nWhen it comes to maintaining a youthful appearance, many patients are solely concerned with facial features such as the eyes, nose, and chin. It is important, however, to preserve the appearance of the neck as well, which is particularly vulnerable to wrinkles and sagging. Neck lift surgery removes fat deposits around the neck and tightens skin that has lost elasticity. This procedure can be used to respond to sun damage, eliminate a “double chin,” and sculpt a strong, attractive jaw line.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Fat Transfer</h2>\r\nWhile most facial plastic surgery procedures involve removing skin and fat, other procedures such as fat transfer use fat to enhance and restructure facial features. This revolutionary procedure, sometimes referred to as autologous fat transfer, uses fat from the patient’s own body to add volume to areas of the face that have been affected by aging and stress. This procedure is an attractive alternative to facial fillers because it typically lasts longer, and does not involve the injection of foreign materials into the body.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Contact Mitts Plastic Surgery Today</h2>\r\nDr. Mitts is dedicated to helping each of his patients feel confident and happy every time he or she looks in the mirror. He understands the importance of having a unique, attractive look and is pleased to offer a variety of procedures that can be customized to suit the cosmetic goals of all of his patients. If you have considered making changes to the appearance of your face, we encourage you to learn more about the facial plastic surgery procedures offered at our Bakersfield practice serving Bakersfield and Tulare County.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>'),

He understands that many individuals are unhappy with certain aspects of their appearance, and takes great pride in his ability to help patients achieve their cosmetic goals. Dr. Mitts gets to know his patients as individuals so that he can fully understand their unique needs and desires. This dedication to the highest level of patient care, coupled with the use of the latest treatment techniques and tools, has allowed Dr. Mitts to achieve stunning cosmetic results for patients for more than 20 years. By offering a wide range of body sculpting treatments at his Bakersfield , California practice, Dr. Mitts gives all of his patients the opportunity to have the body of their dreams.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in enhancing your appearance through body contouring procedures, contact Mitts Plastic Surgery serving Bakersfield and Tulare County today to see for yourself how the friendly, individualized care from Dr. Mitts and his staff can help you make your ideal body a reality.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Liposuction</h2>\r\nDr. Mitts strives to offer the most advanced and effective, least invasive body sculpting treatments to his Bakersfield patients. He is pleased to perform both internal and external ultrasonic liposuction. Like traditional liposuction, ultrasonic liposuction removes unwanted fat from several areas of the body. However, this advanced technique uses high-pitched sound waves to liquefy fat prior to removal, enhancing Dr. Mitts’ ability to remove particularly dense pockets of fat. Ultrasonic liposuction can simultaneously tighten the skin, making it a preferred treatment option for patients who do not want to undergo multiple surgical procedures.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Tummy Tuck</h2>\r\nFor many individuals, stubborn belly fat is holding them back from their ideal body. A tummy tuck, also referred to as abdominoplasty, is a comprehensive body contouring procedure that removes fat from the abdomen and tightens underlying muscles, resulting in a sleek, attractive look. Not only can a tummy tuck help patients fit into smaller sizes, but it can also drastically improve their self-confidence. Dr. Mitts also offers the mini-tummy tuck for less of an extended scar. Call to see if you qualify for this surgery.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Thigh Lift</h2>\r\nLoose, excess skin on the upper legs can be a cause for self-consciousness, especially among women. The thigh lift procedure can eliminate fat in the thighs and tighten the skin, giving patients a slender, healthy appearance. This body sculpting procedure can target both the inner and outer thighs, and is ideal for patients who have experienced weight fluctuations. Many patients choose to combine this treatment with other procedures such as gluteal implants, or a butt lift.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>Gluteal Implants</h2>\r\nDr. Mitts offers gluteal implants, also known as butt implants, to his Bakersfield patients who desire a shapely figure. Gluteal implants are made of silicone and can vary in size and shape based on individual preference. In addition to adding curves to the body, gluteal implants give patients more clothing options and help them feel confident about their shape.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 mt-20\">\r\n<div class=\"doctor-text\">\r\n<h2>More Information on Body Sculpting</h2>\r\nWhen patients feel good about their bodies, it can enhance their lives in so many ways. It is the ability to improve his patients’ lives that makes Dr. Mitts so passionate about plastic surgery.
